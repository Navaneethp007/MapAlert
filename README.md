# MapAlert 🌍📍  

## Overview  
**MapAlert** is a mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo** that provides real-time alerts when users are **2 km away from their selected destination**. The app also allows users to **search for locations**, with markers placed at selected destinations.

## 🚀 Features

- **🚨 Proximity Alert System**  
  - Compares the distance between the user's current location and their selected destination.

## 🔄 How It Works  

1. **Search/Select for a Location**  
   - Users enter a place name, and a marker is placed on the map.  

2. **Start Tracking**  
   - The app continuously updates the user’s location in the background.  

3. **Trigger Alert**  
   - When the distance between the user's current coordinates and the selected destination drops **below 2 km**, an alert is displayed.
